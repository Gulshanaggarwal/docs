# Contributing

Thanks to declarative programming, we have a brand-new approach to data and logic. As we are still discovering what we can do with this powerful programming model, please join us with any types of contribution!

## Declarative Runtime Environment

Nucleoid is a declarative runtime environment that applies declarative programming at the runtime as rerendering JavaScript statements and creating the graph, so as a result, the declarative runtime system isolates a behavior definition of a program from its technical instructions and executes declarative statements, which represent logical intention without carrying any technical detail.
